# FROST

This repository provides the code for replicating the experiments in our research "FROST: Faster and more Robust One-shot Semi-supervised Training".

This repository contains two sets of codes: one for the PyTorch version that is contained in the folder PT-FROST and the other for the TensorFlow version that is contained in TF-FROST. TF-FROST will be released to public in Nov. 2020.  Both folders contain README files that describe how to install dependencies, setup the datasets, and run the codes to replicate our experiments.

Additional information is available in the Appendix of our paper (to be published).
